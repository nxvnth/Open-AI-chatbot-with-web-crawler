Cost-saving became an outcome of the process rather than the desired result. Healthium never had this level of visibility over expenses in the past. With the adoption of Concur Expense management system, everything became so transparent and seamless. All expense data can now be seen in one place, spending policies can be easily enforced, receipts and reporting have become automatic and employees are reimbursed swiftly.
