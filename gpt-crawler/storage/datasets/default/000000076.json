We have created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to the individual’s right to data protection and privacy. It outlines how we handle information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify an individual (“personal data”). \n\n1. Who do we mean when we say SAP in this Privacy Statement?\n\nThis privacy statement applies to the collection and processing of personal data: (i) during the central operation of this website and other globally operated SAP Concur business activity by Concur Technologies, Inc., 601 108th Avenue NE, Suite 1000, Bellevue, WA 98004 (“SAP Concur US”), or a specific SAP group entity as may be stated in the Additional Country and Regional Specific Provisions at the end of this privacy statement; (ii) in the context of a pre-contractual or contractual business relationship with you or your employer by SAP Concur or Concur Holdings (Netherlands) B.V.

Any references to “SAP” mean SAP SE, SAP America, Inc. or the applicable SAP group entity.\n\nThis privacy statement does not apply to SAP internet-pages or web-services which present their own Privacy Statement.\n\n2. For what purposes does SAP process your personal data?\n\nWhen conducting business and operating our various web presences and other communication channels, SAP Concur processes personal data of the people it interacts with, including customers, partners, suppliers, vendors, candidates, and any other people with whom we interact.\n\nIn any of these cases, SAP Concur may process personal data for one or more of the following business purposes:\n\nA. To pursue business relationships with customers, partners, and others\n\nSAP Concur processes personal data to pursue its business relationships with customers, partners, and other users to fulfill pre-contractual and contractual business relations. This may include satisfying requests, processing orders, delivering an ordered product or service, or engaging in any other relevant action to establish, fulfill and maintain our business relationships.\n\nProducts and services may include any cloud software products, web services, apps, online-forums, webinars and events, non-marketing related newsletters, white papers, tutorials, trainings, as well as other offerings like contests or sweepstakes. When you purchase or intend to purchase products or services from SAP Concur on behalf of a corporate customer or are otherwise associated as contact person for the business relationship between SAP Concur and a corporate customer or partner (a “Customer Contact”), SAP Concur will use your personal data for this purpose. More specifically, SAP Concur may use your personal data to confirm your opening of an account, manage the contract execution, send you disclosures as may be required by law, notice of payments, and other information about our products and services. SAP Concur may respond to related inquiries, provide you with necessary support and process your feedback.\n\nIn the context of your or your employer’s use of our products or services, SAP Concur may communicate with you by post, email, live chat, contact forms, phone or any other medium to resolve your, a user’s, or a customer’s question or complaint or to investigate suspicious transactions. In case of telephone calls or chat sessions, SAP Concur may record such calls or chat sessions to improve the quality of services of SAP Concur after informing you accordingly during that call and, subject to applicable law, receiving your prior consent before the recording begins.\n\nWithin an existing business relationship between you or your employer and SAP Concur, SAP Concur processes your personal data to help us understand how satisfied you are with the functionality and quality of our products and services, to provide you with relevant information on our latest product announcements, software updates or upgrades, events, special offers, and other information about software and services of Concur that is relevant and useful to you.\n\nB. To develop products and services\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, SAP Concur may process your personal data for internal research, technological demonstration and development, and to help SAP Concur create, develop, operate, deliver, improve, upgrade or enhance SAP Concur products and services. SAP Concur may process personal data to create anonymized data sets which may then be used to improve products and services of SAP Concur.\n\nC. To ensure compliance with laws and regulations\n\n SAP Concur processes your personal data for the purpose of ensuring an adequate level of technical and organizational security of its products, services, online events, facilities, and premises. For this, SAP Concur will take the measures necessary to verify or maintain the quality and safety of a product or service which is owned, manufactured by or for, or controlled by SAP Concur. This may comprise the use of personal data for sufficient identification and authorization of designated users, internal quality control through auditing, analysis, and research, debugging to identify and repair errors that impair existing or intended functionality, account and network security, replication for loss prevention, detecting security incidents, protection against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and prosecuting those responsible for such kind of activity. We may further process your name, likeness, and other contact or compliance related data when you visit a local SAP Concur affiliate or lab in the context of access management and video surveillance to protect the security and safety of our locations and assets.\n\n SAP Concur and its products, technologies, and services are subject to the export laws of various countries including, without limitation, those of the European Union and its member states, and of the United States of America. Applicable export laws, trade sanctions, and embargoes issued by these countries oblige SAP Concur to prevent organizations, legal entities and other parties listed on government-issued sanctioned-party lists from accessing certain products, technologies, and services through its websites or other delivery channels (e.g. the European Union Sanctions List, the US sanctions lists including the Bureau of Industry and Security’s (BIS) Denied Persons Lists (DPL), the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN-List) and the US DOCs Bureau of Industry and Security’s Entity Lists and the United Nations Security Council Sanctions). SAP Concur processes personal data to the extent necessary to comply with these legal requirements. Specifically, SAP Concur processes personal data to conduct automated checks against applicable sanctioned-party lists, to regularly repeat such checks whenever a sanctioned-party list is updated or when a user updates his or her information. In case of a potential match, SAP Concur will block the access services and systems of SAP Concur and contact the user to confirm his or her identity.\n\nIf necessary, SAP Concur uses personal data to prevent or prosecute criminal activities such as any form of cybercrime, the illegal use of our products and services or fraud, to assert our rights or defend SAP Concur against legal claims.\n\nD. To comply with data protection and unfair competition law related requirements.\n\nDepending on the country in which the relevant SAP group entity operates, and whether you have expressly consented to or opted out of receiving commercial information, SAP Concur may process personal data necessary to accommodate your data protection and privacy choices for the receipt of such information and, when necessary to ensure compliance, exchange such information with the other entities of the SAP group.\n\n E. To operate SAP Concur internet pages, web-offerings, or other online events\n\nSAP Concur processes personal data for the purpose of operating, providing to you and administering your use of its internet pages, web offerings, or other online events.\n\nCreating user profiles\n\nCertain web offerings linked to websites, including forums, blogs, and networks of SAP Concur (e.g., the SAP Concur Community), require you to register and create a user profile. Through the user profile you can share personal information about you with other users, such as your name, photo, social media accounts, postal or email address, telephone number, personal interests, skills, and basic information about your company. The user profiles serve to personalize the interactions between the users (for example, by way of messaging or follow functionality) and to allow SAP to foster the collaboration and quality of communication through such offerings. The profile settings of the relevant web offering allow you to determine which information you want to share.\n\nIdentity service\n\nThe user profile may be specific to a single web offering of SAP Concur, but it also allows you to access other web offerings of SAP Concur or of other entities of the SAP group. It is your choice whether or not to use any of these additional web offerings. If you do, SAP Concur will make your personal data available to such other web offerings to provide you with initial access. Kindly note that without your consent for SAP Concur to create such user profiles, SAP Concur will not be able to offer such services to you where your consent is a statutory requirement that SAP Concur can provide these services to you.\n\nEvent profiling\n\nIf you register for an event, seminar, or webinar of SAP Concur, SAP Concur may share basic participant information (your name, company, and email address) with other participants of the same event, seminar, or webinar to promote the interaction between the participants and to stimulate the communication and the exchange of ideas.\n\nUser experience improvement\n\nSAP Concur processes information that relates to your visit to our web offerings to improve your user experience, identify your individual demand and to personalize the way we provide you with the information you are looking for. For this purpose, we collect information regardless of whether you register with a user profile or not.\n\nCookies and similar tools\n\nSAP Concur processes personal data about the users of SAP Concur websites and other web offerings using cookies or similar technologies for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement and its Cookie Statement.

SAP Concur may also invite you to participate in questionnaires and surveys.

If you nonetheless provide your personal data, SAP Concur will use it for the purpose stated in the questionnaire or survey or to improve its products and services.\n\nTo keep you up to date\n\nWithin an existing business relationship between you or your employer and SAP Concur, SAP Concur processes your personal data to inform you about SAP Concur products or services which are similar or relate to products and services you or your employer have already purchased or used. SAP Concur will inform you by email or phone about such news only as far as it is allowed by law, or if SAP Concur has collected such information in the context of the business relationship. You are entitled to object to the use by SAP Concur for this purpose at any time by selecting the opt-out option at the bottom of each marketing related approach.\n\nPersonalized Content\n\nSAP Concur processes information about your interactions with SAP Concur across its various business areas and its offerings (your or your employer’s prior and current use of SAP Concur products or services, your participation in and use of SAP Concur web offerings, events, white papers, free trials or newsletters) to provide you with the requested products and services and to improve our personal communications with you. This data may also be used to efficiently operate the business of SAP Concur, which also includes: the automation and aggregation of data to support various analytic and statistical efforts, performance and predictive analytics and exploratory data science to support your customer journey and to fulfill such requests. To the extent permitted by law, SAP Concur may combine and use such information in an aggregated manner to help us understand your interests and business demands, develop our business insight and marketing strategies, and to create, develop, deliver, and improve our personalized communications with you. It may also be used by SAP Concur to display relevant content on SAP Concur owned or third-party websites.\n\nAdvertising ID’s\n\nProvided your consent or to the extent permitted by applicable law, SAP Concur may create a hashed user ID to provide to third party operated social networks or other web offerings (such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram or Google).
