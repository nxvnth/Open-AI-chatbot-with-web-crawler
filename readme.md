# Open-AI-chatbot-with-web-crawler
old:
list of things to do:
1. remove all the json files in datasets
   1.1 either by changing the way output 1 json is generated
   1.2 or delete all files after the output 1 file has been generated

2. rn make a menu driven setup where 2 options
  2.1 start the crawling and vector embedding process in case site got updated
  2.2 run the chatbot
      2.2.1 has to check whether the json file is there otherwise should prompt to do 2.1!
      
current: completed the todo list and also uploaded the embeddings so that you have something to work with to figure out how it works
